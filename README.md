# Projects

### **`Stranded`**

<!-- Follow: https://krausefx.com/ Pattern
  The Problem
  the Solution + images
  how it works + images
-->

#### _Background:_
_ORD_ 🛫 _MIA_ 🛬 _ETD 2:00 hr_

What's there to do at an airport besides waiting for your flight?

What about if we could meet someone?... Don't worry is not tinder

What's the ice breaker?

Math ➗ is international spoken, music 🎼 is international heard, body language too. A language_ 🗣 not so much 😕

🎺 + 💃🏻 + 🕺🏻 = social interaction

You don't need to talk when dancing Foxtrot, Salsa, Tango or Swing!

#### _The Solution: Coming soon_

🙂 Stranded brings people together at an international place (airport) in different time zones! 😲 Allowing them to socialize through dancing `<insert research paper here>`

### **`mmMapp`**

#### _Background:_
Have you ever had too many events in the same day at different times and different locations?

Were the events or appointments located close to each other?

Do you always take into consideration how long will it take you to go from appointment A to appointment B?

What about lunch? Do you have time to eat in the middle?

Or where you live? Chicago? Great city transit by the way! 5x_ ⭐️ _Miami?_ ☹️ _Sorry its an 1:40 min traffic along the I-95

**But most importantly!**
How happy or how stress are you? ⛱ 🤯

#### _The Solution: Coming soon_

### **`Display vCard`**

![](img/contact.jpg)

#### _The Problem:_

_Do you have a business card? it probably has a cool design_ 📇

_They are useful when you need to leave in a rush_

_There is a individual in the middle, or "man in the middle"_

_manual work is prompt to error_

#### _The Solution:_

- _Update your information properly, inside the contacts app_
- [Install Shorcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/18cf866696df49e69c4e64bbf4a16e7a) 🛠
- _Select your contact card inside the shortcut "add contacts" step, it will show "me" on the right hand side of the list item_
- _Now everytime you have to leave in a rush have the person use the **built-in! camera app**_ 📲📷 _to scan your contact in one second_

_**Note:** also use "Share sheet" to send it using AirDrop, not too many users allow airdrop from everyone_
