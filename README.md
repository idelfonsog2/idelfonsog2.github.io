# Mobile Applications 

## Stranded

<!-- Follow: https://krausefx.com/ Pattern
  The Problem
  the Solution + images
  how it works + images
-->


#### _Background:_
_ORD_ 🛫 _MAD_ 🛬 _ETD 14:00 _

Waiting for your flight? How to start a conversation with someone? Maybe a dance... In order to dance you only need a smile and good energy
Math ➗ is international known. Music 🎼 is international heard. Dance, sculpture, literature, design, cuisine are different forms of expressions denoted as Arts which are internally perform.

> ## Social interaction is a human need

YES! It's something we get excited for and even further when we meet, travel or try something new. People can connect with each other despite the different languages, origins, cultures.

#### _The Solution:_
Stranded 🙂 brings people together at international places (airports) in different time zones! Allowing them to discover something new and exciting... and possibly a new friend.

## mmMapp

> ## The ability to keep learning is an invaluable skill

#### _Pitch:_
- Have you ever had too many events in the same day at different times and different locations?
- Were the events or appointments located close to each other?
- Do you always take into consideration how long will it take you to go from appointment A to appointment B?
- What about lunch? Do you have time to eat in the middle?
- Or where you live? Chicago? Great city transit by the way! 5x_ ⭐️ _Miami?_ ☹️ _Sorry its 1:40 min traffic along the I-95

**But most importantly!**
How happy... or how stress are you? ⛱ 🤯

#### _The Solution: Coming soon_

# Databases

## Data Scheduler

When data analysts and data scientists use data, they rely that is accurate and diverse enough in order to come up with these amazing models that help drive business decisions. Data comes from many places and from different times; a system could start collecting data tomorrow or it was already started 20 years ago; Imagine that 😅

#### Music data analyzer scheduler 

This project showcases how to design and schedule a series of jobs/steps using [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org/) with the following purposes
- Backfill data
- Build a dimensional data model using python
- load data from AWS S3 bucket to AWS Redshift Datawarehouse
- run quality checks on the data
- Use or create custom operators and available hooks to create reusable code

## Data Lakes 🚤  with Apache Spark + EMR Cluster

You can take a trip to a polluted lake or clean lake and how the water looks, taste, or where it comes from matters.

Data lakes is a new analogy to what Data Warehouse was till not too long ago. We are still using the same hardware for Data lakes, but with new tools which makes possible to cover more ground. In my previous project [STAR vs 3NF 🥊 SCHEMA](#STAR-vs-3NF-🥊-SCHEMA) I prepared the data to be ready for use by BI applications with the **OLAP cubes**. It's a structure that has been validated and vetted through several implementations and successful cases. When I learned about **Data lakes**: the tools, the language, Serverless (Python, learning Scala) I felt that I save a bit of automation by looking into it. Not to get me wrong, like any other technology it's flexible, there are pros and cons, budget, analysis of your workload, and team work.

> # Data is the new oil 🛢 🤑 and everybody knows it but not really

As I mention, automation, but not really. Instead of creating tables and doing the ETL dance, lets do the **ELT** 💃 dance. In which, we would infer the schema of "table" by setting the following:

```python
df = spark.read.csv('s3a://.../file.csv', sep=';', inferSchema=True, header=True)
df.createTempView("log_data")
user_table = df.spark.sql("""
                        SELECT user_id as id', 'year(ts) as year
                        FROM log_data
                        """)
user_table.show(1)
user_table.write.parquet('users', partittionBy='year')
```

[Jupyter Notebook](resources/data_lake.md)

We will perform our transformation and have them save in **S3** for which our BI apps could connect to or we could attached to the **cluster**, but they are expensive 💰. S3 it's cheap and it doesnt get shutdown.

Another step is the **Schema-on-read** for this process to be possible, and if you catch that there is a lot of steps.

There is some learning that I'm exited to be touching in the near future: data analyst, ML, cloud dev, **data streaming**

## Data Ware🏡 with AWS Redshift

> Why would we want to use re-create our table structures for Analytical Procedures?

It happens that performance is much better, we can do fewer joins and access the same information. We still would like to have our 3NF schema for application purposes. Besides re-creating our tables, these can be improve... by a lot more with the following!

- Non-Columnar Storage (AWS REDSHIFT)
- Distribution table Style (All, even, key), 
- Distribution Keys 🔑

In the first point, I'm talking about creating an ETL process to load this data, but of course there is some setup that needs to be done

> ### _There is an overcrossing between Infra DevOps 🛠 and Data Engineers 💾_

For this project I utilize AWS web services like `redshift`, `s3 storage buckets`, `user roles`, `policies`, and `cloud watch`

The idea is how can we prepare data to be use by _Business Intelligence_ applications like Tableu or even Jupyternotebook! 👍
In order to help the business see an overview of the data in a diagram of what important features of the product their customers might be using. Mainly, how can we improve the performance of these OLAP and OLTP transactions. For that, we use the combination of star schema tables, we build a strategy for a distributed data system, and do grouping for all the features thanks to REDSHIFT.

## Creating an ETL process with Apache Cassandra

### _Handling BIG DATA and storage now a days is no just feasible, it's a must._

```python
import pandas
import cassandra
``` 

Losing customer it's not an option. Today in the world we have a ton of devices that are gathering and sending data. The benefit of using a document store database #NoSQL, is that developers don't need to maintain and/or adjust entities, migrations and changes on existing products. Companies and product moves in an agile environment, where requirements are constantly changing; NoSQL allows us to spin these requirements in a quick manner.

#### The Business Case 💼

The following application establishes the following case where we have deploy a music app and its collecting data which it's the store to a local text file. From that we known which songs does the user listens to and which membership they are on (at a higher level).

```swift
// "Some of the largest production deployments include Apple's, with over 75,000 nodes storing over 10 PB of data, Netflix (2,500 nodes, 420 TB, over 1 trillion requests per day), Chinese search engine Easou (270 nodes, 300 TB, over 800 million requests per day), and eBay (over 100 nodes, 250 TB)." https://cassandra.apache.org/
```
My job was to extract transform and load this data into the system where business teams could bring their requirements and collect solutions from the data.

## Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

```python
cur.execute("DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS ...")
```

Executing the basic CRUD commands is nothing new when it comes to building a system. A well-thought system it's very agnostic, and concepts are transferable within different lower level products. Some of the most popular RDBMS involve PostgreSQL, OracleSQL, MySQL. But where does the data comes from? How often does the data changes? How many files do we have, and how often we get new ones? Can we blame IoT 🛰 devices? 
> To the infinity and beyond... - Buzz Lightyear 1995

In the following application are given directory paths of where the client-side system is storing data files based on a music application product. I analyzed the data, build its entities and form the basic link between them. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to

### **`Hero World`**

Creating a test case for a new park for The Walt Disney Company in order to track schedules and budgeting for the construction of all the projects.

Our dev team was able to implement a database using normalization, which helps identifies the identities inside the projects. We developed a process of Table Creation, Views, Stored Procedures, Triggers. During the project we learned how the activity relates to a project, how a project can have many employees, and how a firm can own many employees. This is done using the concept of a relational database.

# Miscellaneous 

## Lambdas in Swift

Many iOS developers don't realize at the beginning that they are actually using a programming language with Functional Paradigm and Principles.
The Swift language became really popular thanks to iOS applications. Today, the language does not only help builds applications across an array of customer-facing hardware (iOS, WatchOS, iPadOS, CarPlay) but also enterprise-level and research level as of backend applications and machine learning models respectively. Most recently I saw a microcontroller dev kit for people to start building projects that exist with Raspberry Pi but with Swift and it's own IDE

> # "a prototype is worth a 1000 meetings"

Many people say: "well.... its just a Hello World program" or "it lacks the vote from an enterprise point of view" To them I must say there is not an official council who approves or disapproves what technology lives up to the standards. And newer technology aims to address the issues and lack of current technology, how far we can push it, it's only up to us; developers to run with it an see what we like.

Thank you [Fabbian Fett](https://twitter.com/fabianfett) for given us Swift AWS Lambda

## Writing BDD + TDD in my current projects

- **Who writes TDD?** tricky question🤔😅. Best case, its the output of a conversation between: devs, product owners/managers, stakeholders, and quality assurance testers
- **What is TDD?**  write software that assumes your production software is already built and make it compile/pass.
- **Why use TDD?** In order to avoid introducing bugs as you are adding or changing behavior.
- **When?** Drill down what you want your users to achieve _as concepts_ first _**[capabilities]**_
- **Where?** TextEdit! 📑 honestly!
- **How to?** Gherkin + Cucumber...ish + XCTest take a look [Cucumberish - Ahmed-Ali](https://cucumber.io/docs/installation/ios/) 👈🏽👀

> # No method is more effective than a good example. - Ingvar Kamprad, IKEA Founder

####  The Problem
A developer could write the following below. But this is missing some context, and only developers _**could!**_ be able to understand what is the system is doing.

<!-- not java, swift -->
```swift
func testSystem_whenReset_isInStarted() {
 sut.setToInProgress()

 sut.restart()

 XCTAssertEqual(sut.state, .blank)
}

```

#### A different approach: Give me an example

```gherkin
Given the application is "in progress"
When a user "restarts" the application
Then the application will set to "default"
```

```swift
func Given("the application is [regex]") { state in
 sut.set(state)
}

func When("a user [regex] the application") { action in
 sut.perform(action)
}

func Then("the application will set to [regex]") { expected in
 XCTAssertEqual(expected, sut.state)
}

```

The result out of it is that developers can make a set of reusable tests and stakeholders, product owners, QA tester can expand the tests into every state of the system.

Developers only need to keep following their TDD approach.

## **`Display vCard`**

![](img/contact.jpg)

#### _The Problem:_

_Do you have a business card? it probably has a cool design_ 📇

_They are useful when you need to leave in a rush_

_There is an individual in the middle, or "man in the middle"_

_manual work is prompt to error_

#### _The Solution:_

- _Update your information properly, inside the contacts app_
- [Install Shorcut](https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/18cf866696df49e69c4e64bbf4a16e7a) 🛠
- _Select your contact card inside the shortcut "add contacts" step, it will show "me" on the right-hand side of the list item_
- _Now everytime you have to leave in a rush have the person use the **built-in! camera app**_ 📲📷 _to scan your contact in one second_

_**Note:** also use "Share sheet" to send it using AirDrop, not too many users allow airdrop from everyone_
